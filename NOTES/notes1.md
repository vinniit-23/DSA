# WHAT IS DSA ?

DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. 

- **What is a Data Structures ?** 
    A Data Structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed
    and modified efficiently. 

 **Types of Data Structures**
- Linear Data Structures
- Non-Linear Data Structures
- Hash-Based Data Structures
- Advanced / Custom Data Structures


**Linear Data Structures :** Elements are arranged sequentially, one after the other.
- **Array :** Fixed-size, indexed collection.
- **Linked List :** Nodes connected by pointers.
- **Stack:** LIFO (Last In First Out).
- **Queue:** FIFO (First In First Out).
- **Deque:** Double-ended queue.

**Non-Linear Data Structures :** Elements are arranged hierarchically, or in network.
- **Tree :** Hierarchical structure with parent-child nodes.
- **Binary Tree :** Each node has max 2 children.
- **Binary Search Tree :** Binary tree with sorted nodes.
- **Heap :** Complete binary tree (min or max)
- **Trie :** Prefix tree, mainly for strings.
- **Graph :** Nodes (vertices)  connected be edges 

**Hash-Based Data Structures :** Use hash functions to store data for quick access.
- **Hash Table / HashMap :** Key value pairs with fast lookup
- **HashSet :** Stores Unique values
 
**Advanced / Custom Data Structures :**
- **Segment Tree :** Tree used for range Queries
-  **Fenwick Tree (BIT) :** Binary Indexed Tree
- **Disjoint Set (Union-Find) :** Tracks Connected Components
- **Adjacency List / Matrix :** Ways to store graphs <br> </br>
