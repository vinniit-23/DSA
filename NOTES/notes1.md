# DSA Notes

# WHAT IS DSA?

DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. 

- **What is a Data Structures ?** 
    A Data Structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed
    and modified efficiently. 

 **Types of Data Structures**
- Linear Data Structures
- Non-Linear Data Structures
- Hash-Based Data Structures
- Advanced / Custom Data Structures


**Linear Data Structures :** Elements are arranged sequentially, one after the other.
- **Array :** Fixed-size, indexed collection.
- **Linked List :** Nodes connected by pointers.
- **Stack:** LIFO (Last In First Out).
- **Queue:** FIFO (First In First Out).
- **Deque:** Double-ended queue.

**Non-Linear Data Structures :** Elements are arranged hierarchically, or in network.
- **Tree :** Hierarchical structure with parent-child nodes.
- **Binary Tree :** Each node has max 2 children.
- **Binary Search Tree :** Binary tree with sorted nodes.
- **Heap :** Complete binary tree (min or max)
- **Trie :** Prefix tree, mainly for strings.
- **Graph :** Nodes (vertices)  connected be edges 

**Hash-Based Data Structures :** Use hash functions to store data for quick access.
- **Hash Table / HashMap :** Key value pairs with fast lookup
- **HashSet :** Stores Unique values
 
**Advanced / Custom Data Structures :**
- **Segment Tree :** Tree used for range Queries
-  **Fenwick Tree (BIT) :** Binary Indexed Tree
- **Disjoint Set (Union-Find) :** Tracks Connected Components
- **Adjacency List / Matrix :** Ways to store graphs <br> </br>

# What is an Algorithm?
An Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem or performing a task.
- **Types of Algorithms:**
  - **Searching Algorithms:** Find specific data within a structure (e.g., Binary Search).
  - **Sorting Algorithms:** Organize data in a specific order (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
  - **Recursion:** Functions that call themselves to solve problems (e.g., Factorial, Fibonacci).
  - **Dynamic Programming:** Break down problems into simpler subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack).
  - **Graph Algorithms:** Solve problems related to graphs (e.g., Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS).
  - **Greedy Algorithms:** Make locally optimal choices at each step (e.g., Coin Change).
  - **Backtracking:** Explore all possibilities to find a solution (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku Solver).
  - **Divide and Conquer:** Break problems into smaller subproblems (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
  - **Bit Manipulation:** Use bitwise operations to solve problems (e.g., Counting set bits, Power of two).
  - **Mathematical Algorithms:** Solve mathematical problems (e.g., GCD, LCM, Prime Factorization).
  - **String Algorithms:** Solve problems related to strings (e.g., KMP, Rabin-Karp).
